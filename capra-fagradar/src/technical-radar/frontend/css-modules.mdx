A [CSS Module](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is a CSS file where all class names are scoped locally by default.

### Why CSS Modules?

- **Local Scope Prevents Clashes**:
CSS Modules use local scope to avoid style conflicts across different project parts, allowing component-scoped styling.

- **Clear Style Dependencies**:
Importing styles into their respective components clarifies which styles impact which areas, enhancing code readability and maintenance.

- **Solves Global Scope Problems**:
CSS Modules prevent the common issue of styles in one file affecting the entire project by localizing styles to specific components.

- **Boosts Reusability and Modularity**:
CSS Modules allow the same class names in different modules, promoting modular, reusable styling.
